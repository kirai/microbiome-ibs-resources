A portable system for metagenomic analyses using nanopore-based sequencer and laptop computers can
realize rapid on-site determination of bacterial compositions (Kirill 2017) <http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/20/101865>
  - Software used to use the Nanopore in this research paper
    - Oxford Nanopore Metrichor base-calling (Cloud based) 
    - NanonetRNN Basecaller  (Local)  https://github.com/nanoporetech/nanonet
    - Poretools https://github.com/arq5x/poretools
    - Centrifuge (Classifier for metagenomic sequences) , I think this is what makes classification very fast: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/manual.shtml
